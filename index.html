  <h1> <u> Basics of the Web and HTML</h1> </u>

  <form> <b> <u> The Web  </b>  </u> </form> 

  <p> The Web was invented around 1990's and  approximately has 30 billion pages today. Whether it is a  Document or an image or a  video on the web they are linked or glued together through <em>HTML</em>.The Web is a collection of many HTML documents.When a person uses the internet through his <em>browser </em>, a request is placed to the server through <em> HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) </em>. Then the Server finds that particular HTML document and sends it to the user through the same channel.Here is a <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48329854/m-48480496"> video </a> that explains the concept more clearly. </P> 

  <form> <b> <u> HTML </u> </b> </form> 
  <p> HTML stands for <em> Hyper text Markup Language</em>. HTML is made up of <em> text content </em> (what you see ), <em> markup </em> (what it looks like), links to other pages and reference to other documents (like videos or images ). </p>

 <ol>
   <li> <u> HTML Markup  </u> </li>
   <p> HTML Markups are set of commands inserted in a file for a particular display on the browser. They are made up of elements and tags. An example of basic tag is explained in this particular <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48011976/m-48703273"> video</a>. Tags are single commands placed between brackets whereas elements are components of HTML document. This <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444"> video </a> explains it in detail. </p>
   <li> <u> HTML Attributes </u> </li> 
   <p> When a user while writing a HTML Document wants to refer a particular link on the web in this particular document, he uses the HTML attributes for the tag which in this case is an anchor tag. A clear example is given in this <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48508417/m-48723411"> video </a>. </p>

   <li> <u> Inline (vs) Block elements </u> </li>
   <p> Both these elements are used to organise the content. But there is a difference in the usage. Inline elements can display the organised content and span the space of the content. Whereas block elements place an invisible block around the content allowing it to be displayed as a new line. Unlike inline elements, block elements occupy the width of the parent if no width is specified. Here is a <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723438"> video</a> thats explains this concept. </p>

   <li> <u> Whitespace</u> </li> 
   <p> While creating HTML document in order to  add spaces  between the lines or to create a new paragraph, there must be a specific command in the text. otherwise, all the spaces given through tab are deleted while displaying the content. The additional space is called the whitespace  </p>
